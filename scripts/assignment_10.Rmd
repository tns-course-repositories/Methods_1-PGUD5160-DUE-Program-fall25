# If you need/want to make a page break in PDF output, you can use the following code snippet:

\newpage

# This is the section following the `\newpage` page break for PDF.

Remember, typically first load your needed libraries. This week the processing was done in the assignment script; thus we don't necessarily need to load specific libraries for processing in this `.Rmd` example.

Incorporate your plot images and correlation tests as needed to frame your observations about the NYC DOH Restaurant Inspections Data Set. Notice that `echo=FALSE` is set as a parameter to hide the code chunk printing in the final document which gives a cleaner look.

Like assignment 9, for this assignment plotting imports as `.png` is a clean, simple way to incorporate you analysis results.

## Example paths of  `.png` files saved in the `/results` subdirectory that result from Assignment 10 script:


`~/Desktop/assignment_10/results/score_histograms.png`

`~/Desktop/assignment_10/results/corr_pearson.png`

`~/Desktop/assignment_10/results/corr_spearman.png`

`~/Desktop/assignment_10/results/score_vs_criticals_scatter.pn`

`~/Desktop/assignment_10/results/nyc_inspections_map.png`


|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Score + Criticals histograms                 | `score_histograms.png`           |
| Pearson correlation heatmap                  | `corr_pearson.png`               |
| Spearman correlation heatmap                 | `corr_spearman.png`              |
| SCORE vs # critical violations (scatter)     | `score_vs_criticals_scatter.png` |
| NYC inspections map (if data present)        | `nyc_inspections_map.png`        |


```{r, out.width="100%", fig.align="center", echo=FALSE}

knitr::include_graphics("~/Desktop/assignment_10/results/score_histograms.png")
