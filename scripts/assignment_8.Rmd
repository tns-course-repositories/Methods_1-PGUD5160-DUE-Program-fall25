# If you need/want to make a page break in PDF output, you can use the following code snippet:

\newpage

# This is the section following the `\newpage` page break for PDF.

Remember, typically first load your needed libraries. This week the processing was done in the assignment script; thus we don't necessarily need to load specific libraries for processing in this `.Rmd` example.

Incorporate your plot images as needed to frame your observations about the NYC Evictions + Rent Stabilized parcels. Notice that `echo=FALSE` is set as a parameter to hide the code chunk printing in the final document which gives a cleaner look.

Unlike past assignments, for this assignment plotting imports as `.png` is a clean, simple way to incorporate you analysis results.

## Example of an `.png` file saved as `Rplot_Dummy.png` in the `/results` subdirectory:

```{r, out.width="100%", fig.align="center", echo=FALSE}

knitr::include_graphics("/Users/x15/Desktop/c8_assignment/results/Rplot_Dummy.png")

```
