# If you need/want to make a page break in PDF output, you can use the following code snippet:

\newpage

# This is the section following the `\newpage` page break for PDF.

Remember, typically first load your needed libraries. This week the processing was done in the assignment script; thus we don't necessarily need to load specific libraries for processing in this `.Rmd` example.

Incorporate your plot objects as needed to frame your observations about the NYC Permits Data. Notice that `echo=FALSE` is set as a parameter to hide the code chunk printing in the final document which gives a cleaner look.

## Example of Permit Plot from ggplot:

```{r, fig.width=10, fig.height=7, echo=FALSE}
# Load plot rds
gg_permit_plot <- readRDS("~/Desktop/assignment_7/results/gg_permit_plot.rds")

# Print plot
print(gg_permit_plot)
```

## Example of PUMAs median income + number of permits from ggplot:

```{r, fig.width=10, fig.height=7, echo=FALSE}
# Load plot rds
gg_pumas_plot <- readRDS("~/Desktop/assignment_7/results/gg_pumas_plot.rds")

# Print plot
print(gg_pumas_plot)
```


## Example of PUMAs scatterplot of median income + number of permits from ggplot:

```{r, fig.width=10, fig.height=7, echo=FALSE}
# Load plot rds
gg_corr_plot <- readRDS("~/Desktop/assignment_7/results/gg_corr_plot.rds")

# Print plot
print(gg_corr_plot)
```


## Example of an `.png` file saved as `tmap_example.png` in the `/results` subdirectory:

```{r, out.width="100%", fig.align="center", echo=FALSE}

knitr::include_graphics("~/Desktop/assignment_7/results/tmap_example.png")

```
