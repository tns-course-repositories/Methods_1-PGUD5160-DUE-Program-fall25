|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Simultaneity              | Data should refer to the same census reference date.                            | Avoids duplication/omission; ensures consistency.     |
| Periodicity               | Census should be conducted at regular intervals.                                | Generally every 10 years (aligned with UN rounds).    |
| Defined Territory         | Census must cover the entire geographic area of the country.                    | All administrative and settlement areas included.     |

## US Census - Historical Overview

Hollerith punch cards

- Data from ~63 million Americans was encoded onto punch cards; first deployment = 1890 Census

- Each hole corresponded to a binary “yes/no” response—hole present = attribute true.

- **Mechanism**: Metal pins dropped through holes; if a hole was present, the pin completed an electrical circuit.

- **Accuracy**: Improved consistency by reducing clerical errors.

## US Census - Current

- **The U.S. Decennial Census** is a headcount of every person in the country, done once every 10 years. It collects only basic information (age, sex, race, Hispanic origin, relationship, and housing occupancy) to determine representation in Congress and the distribution of federal funds.

- **The American Community Survey (ACS)**, by contrast, is an ongoing yearly survey of a sample of households. It collects much more detailed information—such as education, income, employment, housing costs, and commuting patterns—to provide up-to-date social, economic, and housing data for communities between censuses.

## US Census - Limitations & Biases

| Limitation                       | Brief Definition                                                                                                                                                   |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Undercounting & Overcounting** | Some groups are systematically missed (renters, immigrants, children under 5), while others may be counted more than once (college students, affluent homeowners). |
| **Snapshot in Time**             | Census occurs only once every 10 years, so data quickly becomes outdated in rapidly changing areas.                                                                |
                                                 

## US Census - Limitations & Biases

| Limitation                       | Brief Definition                                                                                                                                                   |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Limited Detail**               | Collects only basic demographic and housing data; richer socioeconomic information (income, education, commuting) comes from the ACS.                              |
| **Operational Constraints**      | Challenges include mail and internet response rates, pandemic disruptions (2020), and uneven follow-up resources.                                                  |

## US Census - Limitations & Biases

| Bias                                   | Brief Definition                                                                                                                                                   |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Racial & Ethnic Bias**               | Categories may not align with lived identities; historically misclassified groups (e.g., multiracial, MENA populations).                                           |
| **Immigration & Citizenship Concerns** | Fear of enforcement or exclusion leads immigrant communities to under-participate, even without a citizenship question.                                            |
| **Geographic Bias**                    | Rural, tribal, and transient urban populations are harder to count, leading to gaps.                                                                               |

## US Census - Limitations & Biases

| Bias                                   | Brief Definition                                                                                                                                                   |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |                                                                      
| **Digital Divide Bias**                | The internet-first 2020 Census disadvantaged those with limited broadband or digital literacy (rural, elderly, low-income groups).                                 |
| **Political Bias & Manipulation Risk** | Because census data drives representation and funding, political actors may influence definitions, redistricting, or population counts (e.g., prison populations). |
